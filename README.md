# Fingerprints of Quality (FPQ) - Anomaly Detection for Additive Manufacturing

![FPQ Logo](logo.jpg) 

Welcome to the public repository for the **Fingerprints of Quality (FPQ)** project—an innovative application focused on anomaly detection for additive manufacturing processes. This repository hosts the codebase, resources, and information related to the FPQ project.

## About the Project

**Fingerprints of Quality (FPQ)** is a cutting-edge project aimed at enhancing the quality control of additive manufacturing processes. The project focuses on developing advanced anomaly detection techniques that can identify deviations from the expected manufacturing outcomes. By leveraging data-driven approaches, FPQ aims to provide manufacturers with the tools needed to ensure the consistency and reliability of their additive manufacturing processes.

## Funding

This project has been generously funded by the **Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz** (German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action) and **Forschungsgemeinschaft Qualität e.V.** (Research Association Quality e.V.) within the scope of the project **21675 N/1 (FPQ)**. The authors express their deep gratitude for the financial support provided by these institutions, which has been instrumental in driving the research and development of FPQ.

## Paper Presentation

We are excited to announce that the results and findings of the FPQ project were presented at the **17th CIRP Conference on Intelligent Computation in Manufacturing Engineering**. The paper delves into the technical details of the anomaly detection techniques employed in FPQ and provide insights into their real-world applications within additive manufacturing. The conference paper will be linked here once it becomes available.
